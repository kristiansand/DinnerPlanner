Getting started with development;
	1. Install NVM using curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.17.2/install.sh | bash"
	2. Use "nvm ls-remote" to get latest version of NodeJS/NPM for dependency management in our project
	3. Use "nvm install versionnumber" to install latest version (Currently v0.11.14)
	4. Use "nvm alias default versionnumber" to automatically load version when opening bash/term
	5. Install relevant packages by; "npm install -g yo grunt-cli bower generator-angular" (-g for globally)
	6. Clone Git repository
	7. Use "npm install" to install all dependencies to node_modules (From project www-directory)
	8. USe "bower install" to install runtime dependencies to bower_components  (From project www-directory)
	9. Both nodemodules and bowercomponents are git ignored, dependencies are managed by Bower and NPM locally.
	10. "grunt test" to launch tests. (Gruntfile.js has information about the task, tests folder for the actual tests)
	11. "grunt serve" to boot up application
	12. "grunt build" to build application for production (Minified, etc)
